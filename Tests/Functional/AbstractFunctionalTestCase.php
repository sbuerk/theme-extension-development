/**
 * Base class of all functional tests, taking care that the extension itself is
 * loaded in the test instance.
 *
 * It extends the `FunctionalTestCase` of `sbuerk/typo3-site-based-test-trait`
 * rather than the one of `typo3/testing-framework` directly. That class extends
 * the framework one and adds what a site based test needs, most notably a
 * `setUpFrontendRootPage()` which can set up a root page without creating a
 * `sys_template` record. Having every functional test go through this class
 * means the whole suite gains that without a second base class — see the
 * "Site based tests" page of the developer documentation in "docs/testing/".
 *
 * A test that needs a site delivering the theme does not arrange one itself:
 * how the theme reaches a site differs between the supported core versions, and
 * that difference lives in exactly one place, {@see ThemeSiteTrait}.
