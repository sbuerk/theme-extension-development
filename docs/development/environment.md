# Development environment

All tests and quality tools run in containers through the
[`Build/Scripts/runTests.sh`](../../Build/Scripts/runTests.sh) wrapper. The only
requirement on the host is a container runtime — **podman** (preferred) or
**docker**. The wrapper pulls the required TYPO3 testing images on first use;
neither PHP nor Composer needs to be installed on the host.

Dependencies are installed into the git-ignored `.Build/` directory. The
wrapper installs them for a specific TYPO3 core and PHP version:

```bash
# Install dependencies for TYPO3 v12 on PHP 8.2 (the defaults).
Build/Scripts/runTests.sh -t 12 -p 8.2 -s composerUpdate
```

`-t` takes `12` or `13`, and re-running `composerUpdate` with a different one
replaces the whole set in `.Build/`. `-p 8.1` is only usable together with
`-t 12`: `typo3/cms-core` 13.4 requires PHP `^8.2`, so the combination cannot
resolve.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The installed dependency set must match the core version a gate is run for.
> See [Dual core setup](dual-core-setup.md) — this is the single most common
> source of false positives in this repository.

Run `Build/Scripts/runTests.sh -h` to see all suites and options.

The wrapper detects whether it is attached to a terminal. Interactively it runs
the containers with `-it`; from a pipe, a wrapper script, an IDE run
configuration or a git hook it drops those flags — podman would only warn, but
docker fails outright, and redirected output would carry TTY control characters.
`--init` is kept either way, so ctrl-c still reaches the process in the
container.

It picks **podman** whenever it is installed and falls back to docker; `-b`
overrides that. There is no reason to pass it locally — the workflows do, and
[why they do](quality-gates.md#why-ci-passes--b-docker) is a property of GitHub
hosted runners, not of this repository.

## Frequently used options

| Option         | Meaning                                                                   |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `-s <suite>`   | Suite to run (`unit`, `functional`, `cgl`, `phpstan`, …).                 |
| `-t <12\|13>`  | TYPO3 core major version to run against. Default `12`, the lowest.        |
| `-p <version>` | PHP version (`8.1` … `8.4`). Default `8.2`. `8.1` is TYPO3 v12 only.      |
| `-d <dbms>`    | Database for functional tests (`sqlite`, `mariadb`, `mysql`, `postgres`). |
| `-i <version>` | Database image version, together with `-d`. `-h` lists the accepted ones. |
| `-b <bin>`     | Container binary, `podman` or `docker`. Auto-detected, podman preferred.  |
| `-n`           | Check only, do not modify files (used by `cgl` in CI).                    |
| `-o <seed>`    | Replay a specific random order seed with `unitRandom`.                    |
| `-h`           | Full help with every suite and option.                                    |

## Suites

| Suite                        | Purpose                                                       |
|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| `unit`                       | PHP unit tests (default suite).                               |
| `unitRandom`                 | Unit tests in random order.                                   |
| `functional`                 | PHP functional tests.                                         |
| `cgl`                        | Coding guidelines, fix in place or check with `-n`.           |
| `phpstan`                    | Static analysis.                                              |
| `phpstanGenerateBaseline`    | Regenerate the PHPStan baseline of the selected core version. |
| `lintPhp`                    | PHP linting.                                                  |
| `checkBom`                   | UTF-8 files must not contain a BOM.                           |
| `checkExceptionCodes`        | Duplicate or missing exception codes.                         |
| `checkMarkdownTables`        | Markdown tables must be formatted, `-- --fix` formats them.   |
| `checkTestMethodsPrefix`     | Test methods must not start with `test`.                      |
| `buildCss`                   | Compile the SCSS into `Resources/Public/Css`.                 |
| `checkCssBuild`              | The committed CSS must match its SCSS sources.                |
| `watchCss`                   | Compile the SCSS, re-compiling on every change.               |
| `npm`                        | `npm` with all remaining arguments dispatched.                |
| `composer`                   | `composer` with all remaining arguments dispatched.           |
| `composerInstall`            | `composer install`.                                           |

| `composerValidate`           | `composer validate --strict` of the root `composer.json`.     |
| `renderDocumentation`        | Render `Documentation/` into `Documentation-GENERATED-temp/`. |
| `setVersion`                 | Apply a version, `-- <version> <type>`.                       |
| `watchDocumentation`         | Serve `Documentation/`, re-rendering on every change.         |
| `clean`                      | Remove build, cache, rendered documentation and test files.   |
| `cleanCache`                 | Cache files and folders only.                                 |

| `cleanTests`                 | Test related files and folders only.                          |

## Passing arguments to the underlying tool

The wrapper parses its own options with `getopts`, so arguments meant for
PHPUnit (or any other dispatched tool) must follow a `--` separator:

```bash
Build/Scripts/runTests.sh -s functional -d sqlite -- --filter DummyTest
```
