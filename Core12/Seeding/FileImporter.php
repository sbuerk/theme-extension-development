/**
 * TYPO3 v12 implementation of {@see FileImporterInterface}.
 *
 * The difference to the v13 implementation is the `use` statement above and
 * nothing else: on TYPO3 v12 the conflict mode is
 * `TYPO3\CMS\Core\Resource\DuplicationBehavior`, a `Core\Type\Enumeration`
 * subclass whose `REPLACE` is a plain string class constant. The native enum
 * `…\Resource\Enum\DuplicationBehavior` the v13 implementation uses does not
 * exist in `typo3/cms-core` 12.4, so naming it in this file would be a fatal
 * error on the only core version this file is ever loaded for.
 *
 * `ResourceStorage::addFile()` casts a string conflict mode with
 * `DuplicationBehavior::cast()` on v12 and raises no deprecation for it — the
 * deprecation is a v13 addition. See {@see FileImporterInterface} for the full
 * reasoning behind the split.
 *
 * Only the `Core12/` directory is registered in the dependency injection
 * container when running on TYPO3 v12, see `Configuration/Services.php`.
 * `#[AsAlias]` makes this class the default implementation of the interface, so
 * consumers type hint the interface and receive the implementation matching the
 * running TYPO3 version. The alias is public because the functional tests
 * fetch it from the container to assert that wiring.
 *
 * The class is plain `final`. Readonly classes are PHP 8.2, and this branch
 * supports PHP 8.1 for TYPO3 v12 — there is nothing to declare `readonly` here
 * anyway, because the service is stateless and has no dependencies. See
 * `docs/architecture/class-design.md`.
 *
 * @todo Remove together with {@see FileImporterInterface} when TYPO3 v12
 *       support is dropped.
 *
 * @internal Part of the seeding implementation, not public API.
